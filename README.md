<h1 align="center">Brain Tumor Classification using VGG16</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. BrainTumors are classiÔ¨Åed as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment planning and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</p>
<p>There are 4 categories in dataset: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, No Tumor, Pituitary Tumor.</p>
<b>Glioma Tumor:</b>
A glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or the spine. Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours.
<b>Malignant Tumor:</b>
A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues.
<b>Pituary Tumor:</b>
Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependent upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma, and carcinomas.
<b>No Tumor:</b>
The Brain scan is normal. No Tumor is detected.

<br><p>In this project, the <b>VGG16</b> (retrained on the dataset) model surpasses other ANN, CNN, and TL models for multi-class tumor classification.</p>
