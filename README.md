<h1 align="center">Brain Tumor Classification using VGG16</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain tumors are among the most aggressive diseases in both children and adults, accounting for 85â€“90% of primary CNS tumors. Annually, about 11,700 people are diagnosed, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 34% for men and 36% for women. Brain tumors are classified into types such as benign, malignant, and pituitary tumors. Accurate diagnosis and proper treatment planning are crucial for improving patient outcomes, with MRI being the most effective detection method.
<br><p></p>This project utilizes the <b>VGG16</b> deep learning model for automated brain tumor detection using MRI scans.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used consists of MRI images categorized into different classes: 
<br><b>Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, No Tumor, Pituitary Tumor</b>
<br><br><b>Glioma Tumor:</b>
A glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or the spine. Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours.
<br><b>Malignant Tumor:</b>
A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues.
<br><b>Pituary Tumor:</b>
Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependent upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma, and carcinomas.
<br><b>No Tumor:</b>
The Brain scan is normal. No Tumor is detected.<br>
